## About This Project
Java script is an e-commerce website where users can customize mugs with text and purchase them.

Customers can add custom text to a selection of different colored mugs. The text can be different colors of different typefaces as chosen by the customer.

### How to Shop:

On landing, the customer is given the choice of customizing a mug or going to their profile where shipping information and previous orders can be seen.

When customizing a mug, there are inputs for text, the color of the mug, typeface, color of text, and quantity. Once all are chosen, the item can be added to the cart which generates the price. on checkout, the Stripe integration takes over and processes the payment.
